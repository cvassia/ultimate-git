Lord Vader. You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker. He's no good to me dead. He will not be permanently damaged. Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee? They must never again leave this city. That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter! Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly. No. Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here. This deal's getting worse all the time.

So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire. So you're part of the mining guild then? No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves. Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down? That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever. We would be honored if you would join us. I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too.

What happened? Where? Found him in a junk pile? Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him? Lando's got people who can fix him. No, thanks. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything? Not really. You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us among the clouds. Thank you. Will you join me for a little refreshment? Everyone's invited, of course. Having trouble with you droid? No. No problem. Why?

So was I, if you'll remember. He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training. But I've learned so much. Will he finished what he begins? I won't fail you - I'm not afraid. Oh, you will be. You will be.

I don't...I don't believe it. That is why you fail.

Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five...to one. Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

Steady, Rouge Two Activate harpoon. Good shot, Janson. One more pass. Coming around. Once more. One more. Cable out! Let her go! Detach cable. Cable detached. Come on! Whooha!! That got him! I see it, Wedge. Good work. I don't think we can protect two transports at a time. It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no choice. Launch patrols. Evacuate remaining ground staff. No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right? Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Artoo! You be more careful. Artoo - that way! Artoo! Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste very good. Anything broken? If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy.
