# My love for git	

 ### Some words for you my git	


 + As the sun rises in the east  	
  So the breaking dawn of my love begins  	
  As the sun sets in the west  	
  I am overwhelmed with a burning desire  	
  A desire locked down deep inside  	
  One that cannot be concealed anymore  	
  I long for one sweet kiss to quench my thirst  	
  I long for one tender touch that will last a lifetime  	
  At the end of it all you are my deepest desire!  	
  I love you not today, nor tomorrow, but forever!  	


 + You came into my life like a star  	
  And filled my heart with joy  	
  You took my pain as if it was yours  	
  And gave me love that no one could.  	
  You gave me a shoulder to cry on.  	
  You were my pillar when I was falling.  	
  You were my strength when I felt low  	
  You made my living on earth worthwhile.
